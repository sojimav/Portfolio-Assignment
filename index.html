      <p>This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs provided. 
        I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and JavaScript for the areas that required interactivity, 
        such as the testimonial slider.

      <p>
        This was a small project which mostly consisted of HTML and CSS. 
        I built a fully-responsive landing page. The only JavaScript this
         project required was to enable the toggling of the mobile navigation.

      <p>
        This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. 
        I had mobile and desktop designs to work to and built it so that it was fully-responsive. 
        I took a mobile-first approach and used modern CSS like Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes.
